5 ContributorsNocturama LyricsI passed by the Silent Tiger
The Ailing Ape
The Forgotten Llama
The Penguin face down in the water
I retreat into the Nocturama

When will I ever be your husband?
When will you ever be my bride?
When will you take me from this place
Where hope and hopelessness collide?

To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
Again and again Baby I'm not that strong
I've got a chain around my ankle and it's dragging me down
Well nothing moves behind the glass
Deep inside this artificial night
Tiny eyes blink from the darkness
Saying everything will be alright
You might also likeIt'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side

Well again and again Baby I'm not that tough
When Night falls 'round here it's never Night enough

To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
To be by your side
Again and again and again and again...Embed +
