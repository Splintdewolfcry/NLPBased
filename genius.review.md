## Code Smells

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The `search_the_song` function is called twice in the `write_song_lyrics` function.
* The code is not very modular. The `lyrics_bit` function does too much. It searches for the song, writes the lyrics to a file, and then reads and prints the lyrics. These tasks could be broken up into separate functions.
* The code is not very secure. The API token is hard-coded into the code. This makes it easy for someone to steal the token and use it to access your account.

## Technical Debt

The code is not very well-tested. There are no unit tests, and there are only a few integration tests. This makes it difficult to catch bugs before they go into production.

## Security Issues

The API token is hard-coded into the code, which makes it easy for someone to steal the token and use it to access your account.

## Maintainability

The code is not very easy to maintain. The functions are not very well-named, and the code is not very well-organized. This makes it difficult to make changes to the code.

## Following Patterns

The code does not follow any standard Python coding style. This makes it difficult to read and understand the code.

## Following Best Practices

The code does not follow some of the best practices for Python code. For example, the code does not use exception handling.

## Potential Amount of Bugs

The code has a high potential for bugs. The code is not very well-tested, and there are a number of potential security issues.

## Number of Code Duplicates

The code has some duplicate code. The `search_the_song` function is called twice in the `write_song_lyrics` function.

## Efforts Spent on This Code

It is difficult to say how much effort was spent on this code. However, it appears that the code was not well-developed.

## Score from 1 to 12, based on the level of seniority

I would give this code a score of 2, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very well-written, and it has a number of potential problems.
